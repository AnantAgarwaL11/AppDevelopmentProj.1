# RECIPE APP 

This project is to create an Android application which the user could use as a guide to cook with the time duration it will take . The goal of the application is to simplify the meal choice by using only the ingredients found at home. The user will input the ingredients readily available, input some restrictions; such as low fat, high calories, etc, and the application will display recipes which use the available ingredients and restrictions.
